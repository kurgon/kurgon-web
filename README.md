# My website

This is my website, written in SvelteKit. Every rendition of my website will be stored here.

# Building

I haven't done any crazy stuff with this website, so build instructions are fairly simple:

```bash
yarn # Install all dependencies
yarn build # Build website
```

Very simple, based off SvelteKit skeleton template.
